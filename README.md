# Bivariate extremes - code used in thesis
The following code was used in each chapter:
- Chapter 3,  Figure 3.1: 'Space transformation.Rmd'
- Chapter 5:*
  - Section 5.2: 'Analysis of temperature data (Dataset 1).Rmd'
  - Section 5.3.1-5.3.3: 'Analysis of rain-wind data (Dataset 2).Rmd'
  - Section 5.3.4: 'Small simulation study - bivariate normal data.Rmd'

  - The following two datasets were used:
    - Dataset 1 (temperature data): kim-bloem_temp.csv
    - Dataset 2 (rain and wind data): cape-town_rain-wind.csv

>[!NOTE]
*A few R functions were modified for performing the analysis of the two datasets. See the file called 'Modified functions.Rmd'. First run the code in this file before running the chapter 5 code.
